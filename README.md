# Decisions Made

-   I used plain CSS for layouts, no need to introduced a full framework.
-   I used inline styles in React, for quick updates all in JavaScript
-   I used BootStrap for more of a component based approach
-   I used Octokit instead of axios, since it was written specifically for GitHub
